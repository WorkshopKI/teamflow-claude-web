## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

TeamFlow AI is built on modern web technologies with a focus on local-first principles:

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router), React 18, TypeScript
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: Zustand (lightweight, local-first friendly)
- **Database**: IndexedDB via Dexie.js
- **Synchronization**: Yjs (CRDTs) + y-webrtc (P2P)
- **Workflow Editor**: React Flow
- **AI Integration**: LangChain/LangGraph (planned)

### Core Principles

1. **Local-First**: Data lives on your device, syncs peer-to-peer
2. **Privacy-First**: End-to-end encryption, no data harvesting
3. **Offline-First**: Full functionality without internet
4. **Zero-Config**: No setup, no servers, just start working
5. **Extensible**: Plugin architecture for community contributions

## üìñ Core Concepts

### Tasks & Projects
Organize work with flexible task management. Assign tasks to humans or AI agents, set priorities, track dependencies, and collaborate in real-time.

### Personas
Every team member‚Äîhuman or AI‚Äîhas a persona defining their role, skills, and capabilities. Create custom AI agents tailored to your workflow.

### Workflows
Automate repetitive processes with visual workflows. Trigger actions based on events, schedules, or manual invocation. Delegate complex steps to AI agents.

### Teams
Invite collaborators with a simple link or QR code. Peer-to-peer sync ensures everyone stays updated without a central server.

## üéØ Use Cases
